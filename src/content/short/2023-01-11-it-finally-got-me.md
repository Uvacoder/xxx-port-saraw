title: It finally got me
---
Three years lying in wait, trying to avoid a disease is a long time.

And then it got me anyway, 3 months after the last booster, my 4th vaccination against covid-19.

All that time, I've been reading stuff, some of it horrific, about the dangers of microclots, long covid, loss of brain function.

I'm worrying about every headache, am I losing cells?

Watching the elder of my two sons who has also tested positive, for any signs of Bad Things that may be happening on his insides.

It's scary.
