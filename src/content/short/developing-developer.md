I've just decided that the term 'developer' does not only refer to my working output, but also to myself. I am developing.

The many definitions of development are all about growth, change, realisations, processes, renewal, improvement, advancements in skills/ability/quality...

To be an effective developer in a field which is constantly changing, we have to keep developing ourselves to keep up with it.

As if the code and the people are all part of the same ongoing process of development.
