Since doing a lot of reading around accessibility I'm finding myself being so frustrated by a bunch of the children's books I read to my kids at bedtime.

SO MANY of them have terrible text contrast with the background. Questionable typeface choices. Unclear which word or sentence comes next, when they are placed randomly on the page.

Also for the other olds - varifocals are so annoying at the distance you hold a picture book when reading to a child!
