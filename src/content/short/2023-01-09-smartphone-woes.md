title: Smartphone Woes
---
Oh woe. After many drops of my phone - even outdoors on concrete - where it survived, the screen finally went ping after falling off our sofa onto the wooden floor.

Sadly the Pixel 4a isn't very fixable; parts are hard to get and then they're hard to fit.

Second hand they still cost a lot in Germany, but apparently not in the UK, where I've sourced one for far less to be sent to my mother.

Now I've put a screen protector on this smashed one to keep the shards of glass in place however, I'm finding myself still fond of it. It still works fine. I don't want to start using the 'new' one and break that one too!

I'll be glad to have a spare for if/when I really do kill this one. Android phones of this 'compact' size are rare.
