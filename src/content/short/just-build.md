Lately it's become clear that the web isn't so different than it used to be, in function.

You can still just write your own website in HTML, CSS and maybe a sprinkling of JS, like it's 2002. Just for your own fun, your own corner of the net.

Yeah, there are lots of whizbang interactive websites and web apps built with a lot of logic using libraries, frameworks, or site builders, or backed by wordpress - but also - you don't actually need any of that stuff to just put your personal page online.
