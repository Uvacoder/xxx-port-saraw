Wheeeeee, I know I'm a stuck record on this, but honestly riding the highs and lows of #coding is bonkers.

"omg, what does all this mean, I know nothing"
"wait, what if I just change this bit here"
"ooh! that does a thing! but not the right thing"
"nope, not working"
"let's try the next step anyway"
"mmmm nope. maybe I can just copy some stuff and rename the variables to what I want"
"woohoo it bloody worked!!!"
"oof now for all the follow-up work..."

I need a rest between each cycle of this ðŸ’€
