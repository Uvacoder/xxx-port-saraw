title: 'Bye Gmail, hi Fastmail'
---
I have been considering making a jump away from Gmail for a while, I feel like it's a good idea to lessen my reliance on Google.

Finally a few things came together which gave me a direction to go, i.e. to Fastmail.

Sometimes I just have to force myself or I waver for days, getting ever more annoyed - so I bought 3 years of their service.

There's nothing like spending a bunch of money on something to make you use it!
