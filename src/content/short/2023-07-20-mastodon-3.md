I was just scrolling down replies in my notifications looking for a particular thread I wanted to pick back up, and wow.

So many interesting humans and so many thoughtful conversations.

Many of them are new connections, and several are people I long admired on twitter, but couldn't really converse with because there was so much noise, and they had like eleventybillion followers already.

I'm so happy to be connected to all of them on Mastodon. I thank them for making my social media so enriching <3
