MPA is pronounced "oompah"

---

There's a little packet
Zipping across the internet
Traveling from
A server 
To a client
It is part of something
Much bigger than itself, it's 
Deep within a JavaScript bundle, oh no!

MPA-PA, MPA-PA,
It's a website!
MPA-PA, MPA-PA,
S-P-A's trite!
Why call it app when a site is alright?
Now we get MPA-PA!

(Sung to the tune of [Oom Pah Pah from Oliver!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njx_ojr-Hi4) with thanks to [@wwwicked](https://mastodon.green/@wwwicked) for the inspiration!)
