I keep thinking about browser throbbers lately.

We don't see them any more. Why not?

I guess we expect to receive an immediate website skeleton now, and watch that shimmer instead, as the rest of it loads - as opposed to waiting for a server to build a static page to send us.

Back in the day we could watch the throbber until the new page was served up, and then watch it load.

Now if I click a link and don't get moved on almost immediately, I think it's broken.
