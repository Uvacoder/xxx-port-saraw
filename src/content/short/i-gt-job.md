It's just occurred to me that I've recently started describing myself by my job title, in my bio.

For my entire working life I've been allergic to describing myself by my job title, or talking about my work. It was never an identity I wanted to consider myself as, or spend any extra time outside of work hours talking about.

But now I'm finally doing something I mostly find fun, in a company that has good values I agree with, and it's like, oh? All that time, I didn't know this was possible.
