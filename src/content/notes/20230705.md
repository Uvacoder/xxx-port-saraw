So... these will never have a regular structure, I think.

I mean, maybe one will emerge. But I think I prefer the idea of their being a little more free-flowing.

### Life highlights

- Having the realisation that I am happy. Or was, when I realised it! I don't need to have reached "happiness" as I don't really know what that is - but swinging above and below an average level of contentment is perfectly fine with me.
- We had an ant invasion. We saw it off. Hooray!
- I cut my own hair and it turned out OK.
- I introduced my kids to Thunderbirds (so far just some clips from the original 1960s series). They loved what they saw. Octonauts, Paw Patrol, Go Jetters are so derivative...

### Assorted nerdry

- Moved my WIP [scrolly-tabs explainer article](/blog/scrolling-tabs/) to this site instead of Hashnode.
- Shuffled some subdomains around, in an effort to decouple an older domain from my current web presence.
- Every now and then I do a little pull request from (or to? It should really be a merge request imho) the [webri.ng](https://webri.ng/) [GitHub repo](https://github.com/webri-ng/webri.ng). I am a contributor! ðŸŽ‰
