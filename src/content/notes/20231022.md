### Family

We went on holiday - it was good, all-inclusive so minimal effort! But even at an all inclusive resort, parenting 2 young kids 24/7 for a week is still somewhat tiring without the "rest" of the day job while they're at Kindergarten ðŸ˜…

But it was lovely just to have easy warmth, easy food, and no clearing up to do for a week. A+++.

Youngest has now had the operation to reduce tonsils and adenoids and insert ear grommets. The reaction on first wake was "it's so noisy! I want to go home!" so that was a great sign that the grommets did the trick.

After a few weeks speech is already more clear - and loud! I suppose if your surroundings suddenly get louder, you increase your own volume to match or overcome it. And background sounds that went unnoticed before, are now being commented on with "what's that?", like the dishwasher cycle and aeroplanes flying overhead.

### Work

I was somewhat discombobulated after the holiday. Feels like I'm still easing my way back into the codebase. I'm always doing so much research for what seems like only small code additions or changes - but maybe that's just the nature of the beast I'm working with.

I'm very rarely building something entirely new, rather I'm taking something that already exists and adapting it, or fixing bugs, or finishing off something that has been partially built.

Last week I took two days off with absolute exhaustion and a headache. Home life had been really busy, and I was so deeply tired that I knew I would barely be able to look at the screen much less understand the code. Hoping tomorrow will be better.

### HHTML Meet-up

I gave a talk on CSS `color-scheme`! The 3rd [HHTML](https://hhtml.de) meet-up happened for the first time in person, and I was allowed by [Lea](https://lea.lgbt/@lea) to be one of the speakers ðŸ’œ

It was a smooshing together of two [blog](/blog/color-scheme/) [posts](/blog/a11y-aspects/#contrast-levels), and ended up being given in rather a less polished fashion than I had hoped. Because of the way the room was set up, it was much easier to present from my work MacBook than my personal ThinkPad - but I'm really not so practised and navigating around MacOS! So please excuse the fumbling...

[Manuel](https://www.matuzo.at/) (who has been tolerating me on Mastodon for months, ahaha) was there! It was lovely to meet him, finally :)

His talk actually made me think I might like to play with web components, which is no mean feat - I've been very confused and maybe even mildly scared by them:

### Newsletters

Normally I'm sort of allergic to newsletters. They add up and I just don't have the time to read them all - but I've given these three a pass, because they're worth it:

- [Own Your Web by Matthias Ott](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/issue-01/)
- [The Cascade by Robin Rendle](https://buttondown.email/cascade/archive/003-what-would-html-do/)
- [A Good Enough Newsletter](https://goodenoughnews.substack.com/p/season-3-issue-24)

### New additions to [CSS JOY](https://cs.sjoy.lol)

Welcome, both!
