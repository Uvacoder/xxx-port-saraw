### Life
Seen some very variable weather since the last weak note. Storms, hot days, colder days.

#### Swimming
We finally got to try out the neighbour's pool after 6 years of living next to it! The previous neighbours were old, unfriendly and litigious (!) and NEVER even used the pool. They aged further, and died leaving no descendants. Then they left their home to their lovely gardeners!

The gardening couple are totally quids-in now, the value of the land the property is on is already worth a very pretty penny (we know how much it cost us to buy a semi-detached place on just 1/3 of the same sized plot), so they're going to enjoy an excellent retirement :)

#### Light Reading 
Through Bluesky I discovered [Sarah McIntyre](http://jabberworks.co.uk), the illustrator of the [AdventureMice](https://www.adventuremice.com) and promptly bought the first in the series, "Otter Chaos". It's super cute and just the right balance of text to pictures, to read to our 5.5 year old!

### Links and thinks
- [@ppk](https://front-end.social/@ppk) is busy ploughing through writing a CSS book, and [his poll](https://front-end.social/@ppk/110689162046737361) and the ensuing conversation about attribute selectors had me going to [look them all up](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors). Now you can remind yourself too :)
- I finally [did something](https://front-end.social/@sarajw/110695725954043655) about my modifier key muscle memory problem, because of switching between Windows and MacOS. I have had a version of [Windows Powertoys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) installed probably since using win98 or something - so much good stuff is included that I just forget how handy it all is.
- Go look at this handy list of places to find personal websites at https://sizeof.cat/post/website-discovery/
- [Jared White](https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite) has just set up [That HTML Blog](https://thathtml.blog/) and it's off to a great start already! Looking forward to updates :)
