These are becoming more like month notes ðŸ˜„ I knew I was right not to call them week notes!

Anyway, this time we're doing it in unordered-list-style - I started roughing out a post in bullet points and there were so many (despite thinking "I have nothing to tell"), that it can stay that way:

### Kids

- Half birthday party success! No fights or tears even with 11 2-to-6 year olds!
- "DOM" is the name of the big 3-times-a-year funfair that comes to town. We went. It is loud. Overstimulated (me)!
- Tonsils and adenoids reduction and grommets prescribed for the youngest. Hearing improved but still not great, and tonsils are huge, setting off coughing fits at night.
- Gave away the old baby clothes for midwives to give to poorer new families.

### Life

- Upcoming holiday in 3 weeks, yay!
- Climate worries, while also feeling [flygskam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_shame#:~:text=Flygskam%20is%20a%20Swedish%20word,emissions%20to%20thwart%20climate%20change.).
- [Sophie from Mars video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DalnJ-isI5A) about the world not ending is very good. Also very long.

### Health

- More squishy [Oofos](https://www.oofos.com/) shoes bought for sore foot. Would never have bought them at full price, thank you [eBay](https://www.ebay.de/itm/225655093509)!
- Finding online advice for plantar fasciitis is either "go barefoot" or "all the supportive shoes" - why is everything in life so polarised!
- Massage gun was also a nice purchase, though. Make foot go brrr.
- Considering getting COVID vaccination booster again. Off-Label (not currently recommended by national health authority) for the kids?

### Nerdry

- [HHTML meet-up](https://hhtml.de/) plans for end of September! Very looking forward to meeting people :)
- [Keycap covetousness](https://shop.tai-hao.com/products/208t01pp621). Trying not to buy more as I really don't need them.
- [Captcha from Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/spam-filters/#recaptcha-2-challenge) hastly added to website [guestbook](https://sarajoy.dev/guestbook/). Needs the dark mode configuring.
- Letting a hobby-web-dev lull happen. It's cool, no need to stress out about hobbies, they're supposed to be the opposite to stress.

### Talk to me

- As always nowadays I am active on [Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@sarajw) if you fancy a chat. Alternatively [ping me an email](https://sarajoy.dev/#find) or [sign the guestbook](https://sarajoy.dev/guestbook/)!
