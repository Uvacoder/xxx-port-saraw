### Life
Some very variable weather since the last weak note. Storms, hot days, colder days.

We finally got to try out the neighbour's pool after 6 years of living next to it! The previous neighbours were old, unfriendly and litigious (!). They aged further, and died leaving no descendants. They left their home to their lovely gardeners!

The gardening couple are totally quids-in now, the value of the land the property is on is already worth a very pretty penny (we know how much it cost us to buy a semi-detached place on just 1/3 of the same sized plot), so they're going to enjoy an excellent retirement :)
