### Byeee, 2023!

I have simultaneously lots and not very much to say about the year.

Maybe I've already said most of it - in fact, these two blog posts bookend things quite nicely:

January: [How 'Senior Generalist' Sara Side-Stepped](https://sarajoy.dev/blog/saras-side-step/)

December: [This Is My Church.](https://sarajoy.dev/blog/my-church/)

On the family side, things have been fraught as usual, but full of love ❤️

✨ Happy New Year everyone ✨
