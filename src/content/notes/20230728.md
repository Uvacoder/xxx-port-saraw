/me scratches head.

I feel like I haven't much to say this week. Let's see...

### Life

Bought the kids three different kinds of new footwear for various reasons. Trainers (a.k.a. sneakers), wellies (a.k.a. rain boots) and sandals (rubber/plastic ones, also for use by pools/swimming). I also bought them swimming goggles recently. They're about to have a half-birthday\* party next month, so they're having a period of gifts coming up - let's hope they don't get too used to new stuff all the time!

We're taking our annual holiday in September (because they're not school age yet so it's cheaper), but I'm starting to feel mental tiredness, and I think they're pretty tired of Kindergarten too. We might try and take some random days soon just as a rest for all of us (not that having kids at home is much of a rest, but eh!).

\*They both have winter birthdays, as do lots of the family - we get a bit present-fatigued and out of ideas, and it's just blah having a party for their friends around then too. So we have opted so far to run them a joint party in the summer, when we've had time to think of things they might actually need, and the kids can all run around outside if need be :)
