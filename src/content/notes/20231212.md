### Time flies

Gah, how are we halfway through Advent already? Happy Holidays!

I'm limping both physically and spiritually to the end of this year (thanks, plantar fasciitis. Yep still got it). As of next week I'm on vacation until the new year. I'm not sick, just feeling that seasonal malaise.

It's time for a rest (if having the kids home 24/7 for a fortnight is actually a rest, but eh!).

### Work

Good! Been there over a year, now! It's occasionally a little frustrating (I had lots of friendly feedback for my year-end meeting with the CTOs), but I think that's the nature of work. If it was all easy going, it wouldn't be work and wouldn't be worth paying for, no?

We're just embarking on a big accessibility project - I was thanked for pushing the issue - first [Florian](https://cupoftea.social/@zersiax) will audit our app, and then next year he'll help us refactor the bits that most need work to get them accessible. There may need to be a few rounds of this kind of work, I'm so happy that the ball is now rolling!

We just had one of our quarterly 3-day events which was good but also - despite being asked to test every day, people caught COVID left and right. I'm glad we (family) got ourselves jabbed last month. I'm still testing negative ðŸ¤ž

Oh, I also got a nice raise for the coming year ðŸ’¸

My lefty soul is like YOU'RE MORE THAN YOUR JOB and YOUR WORTH ISN'T YOUR SALARY which is all true. But it really helps to feel valued, even if it's THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM which is telling me this is what it means to be valued...

### Fambly

Kids are OK. Snotty. They're loving the Advent treats and twinklies, as am I :)

These are the people it's important to be valued by, and here I thankfully and happily feel secure - even if I worry that I'm not fully earning it and could always improve the mothering and wife-ing!

### Sundries

That's it, brain go 'muhhhhh'. As always, you can [find me on Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@sarajw) and read and/or respond to the nonsense I spout there :)
