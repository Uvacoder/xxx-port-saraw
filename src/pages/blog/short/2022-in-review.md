title: 2022 in Review

I feel like it could either be a very long blog post, or a very short masto one.

Let's go with short:

In 2022, I managed to claw my way out of my depression, and after re-training myself in modern web development, scored a new job in a company that really suits my values, doing work that actually entertains me.

The kids as ever have been a source of joy, frustration, exhaustion and love. My husband is the very best.

In all, it has been a good year ðŸ¥°
