I am a largely neurotypical cis woman, in a happy monogamous hetero marriage, I use she/her pronouns - and I also really love bright colours and rainbows and human rights and dignity for everyone.

I can come across as LGBTQ+ and while that's totally fine with me, I'm just one of the vast majority of cishet normos who deeply dislike any hate on our fellow humans, for just being who they are.
