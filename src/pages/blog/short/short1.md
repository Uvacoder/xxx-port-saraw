Starting to figure out how I would display a bunch of smaller articles on my blog, things that are short and closer to something I would post here rather than in their own blog post.

I feel like occasionally I might decide a toot or an old tweet might be especially genius and worth immortalising. Or something.

Maybe it's just fun to code up the structure/styles for it ðŸ˜Š
