  <p>I do not track you, I do not run analytics, I do not set cookies.</p>
  <p>I <em>do</em> write to session storage, so that you don't get surprised when your chosen high contrast or dark/light modes turn on or off as you navigate around the site. This disappears the moment you close the tab, or browse away.</p>
  <p>The only data I receive from you, is that which you freely give me though the email or guestbook forms. Should you want a copy or would like me to delete anything you sent me, I will happily oblige - <a href="../#find">contact me</a> in whichever way you prefer to ask for this.</p>
